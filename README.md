# PySmart
Smart assistant based on the wolfram-alpha knowledge engine

Notes:

1-In the pysmart.py script you need to change the 'client' variable value
to the value of your own id from the wolfram-alpha api service.

2-In order to make python scripts work properly you need some pre-installed external modules:
- wolfram-alpha  https://pypi.org/project/wolframalpha/
- wikipedia  https://pypi.org/project/wikipedia/
- pyttsx3 https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/
